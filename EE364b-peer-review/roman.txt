This report investigates a few approaches to solve a
non-convex system identification problem using 
successive convex related problems. The innovation
is alternating the objective between optimizing each 
factor in a product, thereby making the problem convex.
To prevent unstable behaviour, regularization is added 
so that the terms do not diverge from each other. 

Pros:
The example grounds the somewhat technical nature of the paper well

The paper flows well from problem presentation to theory to empirical results

The writing style is clear and concise

Cons:
A longer introduction and explanation of the problem would aid 
in understanding the motivation for the underlying problem

The equations are not too clear. The index i appears 
both inside and outside the sums. Which K is constant
and which is being optimized over is not totally clear

A clearer explanation of the sequential optimization problems
would greatly benefit the paper

comments/questions
What method was used to optimize? CVX? 

Is it really reasonable to expect a single input-output pair
to be able to model a system that traditionally takes 2^2N
input-output pairs?
