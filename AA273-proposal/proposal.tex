% Please number citations consecutively within brackets \cite{b1}. The 
% sentence punctuation follows the bracket \cite{b2}. Refer simply to the reference 
% number, as in \cite{b3}---do not use ``Ref. \cite{b3}'' or ``reference \cite{b3}'' except at 
% the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference \cite{b3} was the first $\ldots$''

% Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at 
% the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Do not put footnotes in the 
% abstract or reference list. Use letters for table footnotes.

% Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use 
% ``et al.''. Papers that have not been published, even if they have been 
% submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished'' \cite{b4}. Papers 
% that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in press'' \cite{b5}. 
% Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and 
% element symbols.

% For papers published in translation journals, please give the English 
% citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation \cite{b6}.
