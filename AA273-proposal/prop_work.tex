This project will combine some earlier approaches described in section~\ref{sec:lit-rev} to investigate whether this can improve estimation performance. More specifically, it will use the Riemann Elevator from~\cite{R_elevator} to get a good initial guess for the next time step, where a simpler and faster optimization method like SMACOF or gradient descent can estimate the positions anew. If time permits, some state-based estimation algorithms like the Kalman filter and its extensions will be implemented to get an even better initial guess between time steps.
