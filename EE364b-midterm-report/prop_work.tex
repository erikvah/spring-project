This project will combine some earlier approaches described in section~\ref{sec:lit-rev} to investigate whether this can improve estimation performance. More specifically, it will use the Riemann Elevator from~\cite{R_elevator} to get a good initial guess for the next time step, where a simpler and faster optimization method like SMACOF or gradient descent can estimate the positions anew. If time permits, some state-based estimation algorithms like the Kalman filter and its extensions will be implemented to get an even better initial guess between time steps. Alternatively, some optimization scheme which finds the most likely current and future path from the history of measurement generated by the Riemann Elevator, with some degree of robustness to outliers.
